DeNSE provides a generic platform to investigate growth and network formations
in 2D ensembles of neurons. DeNSE enables to focus on single neuron morphologies,
neuronal interactions and network formation through a large set of tunable and
combinable models.

If you are interested in investigating neuronal morphology, neuronal cultures,
or more complex devices, then DeNSE is the tool you are looking for.

## How to use DeNSE?

As most neuroscience tools, DeNSE provides a Python user interface to give the
user an intuitive and convenient access to all the information regarding the
neurons and the simulation parameters.
DeNSE also integrates well with network libraries such as
[networkx](https://networkx.github.io/), [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/),
or [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/), but also with the
[NEST simulator](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io) via the
[NNGT](http://nngt.readthedocs.io/) package.

To get started with DeNSE, please see the [documentation](http://dense.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
